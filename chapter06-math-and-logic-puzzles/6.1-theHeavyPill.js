The Heavy Pill 
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 Bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but
one has pills that weigh 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact
measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?

You can only use the scale once.

The "can only use the scale once" is a bit confusing. I was
assuming one could place a pill from each bottle on the scale and 
since all but 1 of the pills weigh 1.0 grams, the overweight pill
would be discovered when the reading displays an exact multiple of 1. 
For example, if I have 6 pills and a reading of 6.1, and I remove 1
pill and the reading is now 5.0, I know that the removed pill is 
the overweight one.
