Find maximum single sell profit 

Given a list of day stock prices (integeres for simplicity), find the maximum single sell profit. 

We need to maximize the single buy/sell profit and in case we can't make any profit, we'll try 
to minimize the loss. For below examples, buy and sell priced for making the maximium profit are
highlighted. 

	[8, 5, 12, 9, 19, 1] => buy = 5, sell = 9
	[21, 12, 11, 9, 6, 3] => buy = 12, sell = 11
